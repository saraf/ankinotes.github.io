# Stability Growth determines Retrievability - in simple terms
Created on: 2025-07-13T12:11:38

### 🌟 Simple Explanation: The "Memory Battery" Analogy

Imagine your memory is like a **rechargeable battery**:
1. **Stability (S) = Battery Capacity**  
   - How much *total charge* it can hold  
   - *Example:*  
     - Small battery (S=10) → Holds 10 units of charge  
     - Big battery (S=100) → Holds 100 units  

2. **Retrievability (R) = Current Charge Level**  
   - How much power is *left right now*  
   - *Example:*  
     - 50% charged = 50% recall chance  

3. **Stability Growth (ΔS) = Upgrading Battery Capacity**  
   - When you successfully review (recharge):  
     - You don't just refill → You **install a bigger battery**  
     - Now it holds more power and drains slower!

### 🔋 Why Bigger Batteries = Better Charge
| **Small Battery** (S=10)       | **Big Battery** (S=100)         |  
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| ⚡ Fully charged = 10 units     | ⚡ Fully charged = 100 units     |  
| 🔋 After 1 day: 9 units left (90%) | After 1 day: 99 units left (99%) |  
| ⚠️ After 5 days: 5 units left (50%) | After 5 days: 95 units left (95%) |  

**Key Insight:**  
> The bigger the battery (higher S),  
> the longer it holds a useful charge (higher R over time).

### 🔧 How Upgrades Happen
1. **Trigger**: Successful review when battery is low (R=40-80%)  
2. **Upgrade Size Depends On**:  
   - How low the battery was (lower R → bigger upgrade)  
   - Battery quality (easy cards upgrade faster)  
3. **Result**:  
   - New battery capacity = Old capacity + ΔS

### 🌰 Real-Life Example
**Learning your friend's birthday:**  
- **First review**: Tiny battery (S=2 days)  
  - Forgot after 2 days → Recharged → Upgraded to medium battery (S=10 days)  
- **Now**:  
  - After 2 days → Still 90% recall chance (was 0% before)  
  - After 5 days → 60% recall chance (previously impossible)  

---

### 💡 Why This Matters  
1. **Struggle = Upgrade Opportunity**:  
   Forgetting a little (but recalling) → Triggers biggest battery upgrades  

2. **Easy Reviews Maintain, Hard Reviews Improve**:  
   - Instant recall → Just top-up charge (no capacity upgrade)  
   - Effortful recall → Install bigger battery  

3. **Ultimate Goal**:  
   Grow batteries so big that charge lasts for years!
