# What is a Mature Deck?
Created on: 2025-07-19T21:44:43

A **"mature deck"** is most commonly a term used in the context of spaced repetition flashcard programs like Anki. A deck is typically considered **mature** when the majority (sometimes all) of its cards have reached "mature" status. In Anki, an individual **card is mature when its interval—the amount of time until you will see it again—is 21 days or greater**[4][3][5]. 

**Therefore:**
- A **mature deck** is one where most or all cards have review intervals of at least 21 days[1].
- You can say a deck is mature when most cards have been reviewed and learned to the point that their repetition intervals are 21 days or longer, indicating sustained familiarity with the material[1][4][5].

**Key details:**
- When you first learn a card, it is marked as "new."
- As you review and recall the card successfully, its interval increases from days to weeks.
- **When an individual card's interval reaches or exceeds 21 days, it is considered "mature."**
- If **all or nearly all cards in a deck are mature**, the deck itself is informally considered mature[1][4].

**Note:** The 21-day threshold is somewhat arbitrary but is a convention in Anki to distinguish well-learned content from newer or less-secured knowledge[3][5].
