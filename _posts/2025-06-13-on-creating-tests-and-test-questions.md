# On creating tests and test questions

Creating effective tests and test questions is both a science and an art. Here’s a curated list of **specific resources (books, papers, guidelines, and tools)** you can use to master the skill of designing high-quality assessments — useful for both evaluating your team and reinforcing your own knowledge.

## 📚 **Books**

### 1. **“Classroom Assessment Techniques” by Thomas A. Angelo & K. Patricia Cross**

* 🔍 Contains over 50 assessment strategies you can use in team meetings, training, or internal courses.
* Great for informal and formative assessment design.

### 2. **“How to Prepare Better Multiple-Choice Test Items” by Thomas M. Haladyna**

* 🛠 A detailed guide on writing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that actually measure understanding.
* Covers item writing flaws, distractor quality, and question structure.

### 3. **“Assessing Student Learning: A Common Sense Guide” by Linda Suskie**

* 🎯 Emphasizes alignment between learning outcomes and test questions.
* Especially useful if you plan to set up internal training programs or certification-style tests.

## 📄 **Academic Papers & Guidelines**

### 4. **Bloom’s Taxonomy**

* 🔗 [Bloom’s Taxonomy Reference](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)
* Use it to write questions at different cognitive levels:
  *Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze → Evaluate → Create*

> Example:
>
> * **Remember**: What is the default consistency model of DynamoDB?
> * **Apply**: How would you redesign a DynamoDB table to ensure strong consistency?

### 5. **Vanderbilt University: Writing Good Multiple Choice Test Questions**

* 🔗 [https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/writing-good-multiple-choice-test-questions/](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/writing-good-multiple-choice-test-questions/)
* Concise, practical guidance on how to avoid common test design pitfalls.

### 6. **University of Washington: Guidelines for Test Question Construction**

* 🔗 [https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/assessing-student-learning/writing-test-items/](https://www.washington.edu/teaching/topics/assessing-student-learning/writing-test-items/)
* Includes rules for writing better multiple-choice, true/false, and matching questions.

### 7. **Best Practices for Constructing Written Tests (Medical Education Model)**

* 🔗 [NBME Item-Writing Manual (PDF)](https://www.nbme.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/NBME_Item_Writing_Manual_2020.pdf)
* Though from the medical field, the principles apply universally. Clear examples of common question-writing mistakes.

## 💡 **Templates & Techniques**

| Format Type                   | Guidelines                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multiple Choice**           | Use plausible distractors; avoid "All of the above"/"None..." |
| **Scenario-Based**            | Provide short real-world context, ask for decisions           |
| **True/False**                | Use sparingly; better for warm-up or simple fact-checks       |
| **Cloze (fill-in-the-blank)** | Great for Anki and internal flash quizzes                     |
| **Matching**                  | Effective for terminology-to-concept or API-to-use-case       |

## 🧪 Tools & Platforms

| Tool                  | Use                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anki**              | For spaced testing — turn each test item into a flashcard |
| **Google Forms**      | For quick team quizzes; supports MCQ, checkbox, paragraph |
| **Typeform / Tally**  | Cleaner UI for internal learning assessments              |
| **Quizizz / Kahoot!** | Gamified quizzes if you want something fun and visual     |
