# Cognitively Rich Anki Card Checklist

## SECTION A: UNDERSTANDING AND CLARITY
- Is the question unambiguous?  
- Does the card test a single idea?  
- Is the answer precise, not fuzzy or hand-wavy?  

## SECTION B: THINKING STRUCTURES
- Does this card help me make a distinction?  
- Does it prompt application or reasoning?  
- Does it build a useful schema or mental model?  

## SECTION C: FUTURE USEFULNESS
- Would this card help me solve a real-world problem faster or more accurately?  
- Is the cue (question) something I would naturally think in real life?  
- Would answering this card change what I do in a practical situation?  

## SECTION D: RETENTION AND ENGAGEMENT
- Does it use active recall, not recognition?  
- Is the card emotionally or visually engaging?  
- Is this a card I look forward to reviewing — even a little?  

## BONUS: CARD FORMATS TO CONSIDER
- Q&A – Simple, precise factual recall  
- Fill-in-the-blank – Focus on a key term in context

- Why/When/How – Train reasoning or application  
- What would happen if...? – Systems-level thinking  
- Mini-scenario → What’s wrong? – Diagnostic/debugging skills
