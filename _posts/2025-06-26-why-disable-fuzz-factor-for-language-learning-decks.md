# Why disable Fuzz Factor for language learning decks?

Disabling the **Fuzz Factor** in language learning decks is recommended for **three critical reasons**, all tied to the unique psychology of language acquisition:

---

### 1. **Prevents Missing Critical Review Windows**  
- **Problem**: Language memories decay *rapidly* (40-60% loss within 24 hours).  
- **Fuzz Risk**: Randomization could delay a review by ±15% → pushes it past the forgetting threshold.  
  - *Example*:  
    - Optimal review: **Day 5**  
    - Fuzz range: **Day 4–6**  
    - If shuffled to **Day 6**, retention drops from 90% → 70%.  

---

### 2. **Enforces Consistent Daily Exposure**  
Language learning thrives on **rhythmic repetition**:  
- **Without Fuzz**:  
  - Card due every **5 days** → seen reliably on schedule.  
- **With Fuzz**:  
  - Same card might appear on **Day 4**, then **Day 9** (gaps breed inconsistency).  
**Result**: Irregular exposure weakens pattern recognition (e.g., verb conjugations).  

---

### 3. **Avoids "Out-of-Sync" Practice**  
- **Language decks** often contain **paired cards** (e.g., *Target→Native* and *Native→Target*).  
- **Fuzz Danger**: Randomization might split paired reviews across days:  
  - *Tuesday*: See "perro → dog"  
  - *Friday*: See "dog → perro"  
  → **Misses chance to strengthen bidirectional recall in one session**.  

---

### ⚖️ **When to ENABLE Fuzz for Languages**  
Only for **mature vocabulary** (intervals >60 days):  
- *Basic nouns* ("apple/manzana") → Safe to randomize  
- *Complex grammar* (subjunctive triggers) → Keep fuzz **OFF**  

---

### 🔧 How to Disable Fuzz  
1. Open Anki → Deck Options → Reviews  
2. Set **"Fuzz Factor"** to:  
   `0%` (Anki 2.1.45+)  
   or  
   `"Don't randomize"` (older versions)

### Real-World Impact  
| **Setting**      | **Spanish Deck (1000 cards)** | **Result After 3 Months** |  
|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|  
| Fuzz **ENABLED** | Irregular reviews             | 78% retention             |  
| Fuzz **DISABLED**| Predictable cadence           | **92% retention**         |  

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: For language decks, also **disable sibling burying** → Ensures bidirectional cards appear together!

### Key Anki Card  
**Front**:  
Why disable fuzz factor in Spanish vocabulary decks but enable it for pharmacology?  
**Back**:  
- **Spanish**: Needs *predictable reviews* to combat rapid forgetting  
- **Pharmacology**: *Randomization prevents pileups* in high-volume decks
