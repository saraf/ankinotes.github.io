# Learn how to create good SRS notes or prompts

Learning to write good prompts for spaced repetition is a powerful skill that will help you retain knowledge deeply and efficiently. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you master this skill, based on best practices including insights from Andy Matuschak’s work.

## How to Learn the Skill of Writing Good Prompts for Spaced Repetition

### 1. Understand the Purpose of Prompts in SRS
- **Goal:** Prompts are designed to trigger active recall, which strengthens memory.
- **Remember:** The quality of your prompts directly influences how well you learn.

### 2. Start with Simple, Focused Prompts
- Break down complex information into small, discrete pieces.
- Each prompt should ask about **one fact, concept, or idea** at a time.
- Avoid compound questions that mix multiple ideas.

**Example:**  
Instead of:  
*“What are the steps and ingredients for making chicken stock?”*  
Write:  
*“What is the first step in making chicken stock?”*  
*“Name three key ingredients in chicken stock.”*

### 3. Make Prompts Clear and Precise
- Use unambiguous language.
- Avoid vague or overly broad questions.
- Make sure the question leads to a single, well-defined answer.

**Example:**  
Vague: *“What is cloud computing?”*  
Better: *“Define cloud computing in one sentence.”*

### 4. Ensure Consistency and Tractability
- The answer should be consistent every time you review the prompt.
- Avoid prompts that rely on personal opinion or change over time.
- If a prompt is too difficult or confusing, simplify it.

### 5. Design Prompts That Require Effortful Recall
- The prompt should encourage you to retrieve information from memory, not just recognize it.
- Avoid multiple-choice style questions unless they are carefully designed to promote recall.

**Tip:** Use cloze deletions (fill-in-the-blank) or direct questions rather than passive recognition.

### 6. Use Different Prompt Types
- **Basic Q&A:** Straightforward questions and answers.
- **Cloze Deletions:** Remove a key word or phrase from a sentence.
- **Application Prompts:** Ask how a concept applies in a real-world scenario.
- **Conceptual Prompts:** Ask for explanations or relationships between ideas.

### 7. Practice Decomposing Knowledge
- Take a topic you want to learn and break it down into its fundamental components.
- Create prompts for each component.
- This process helps you understand the material better and ensures your prompts are manageable.

### 8. Review and Refine Your Prompts Regularly
- After using prompts for some time, identify which ones are too easy, too hard, or unclear.
- Edit prompts to improve clarity and focus.
- Remove or rewrite ineffective prompts.

### 9. Use Mnemonic Medium Techniques
- Interleave reading and prompt creation.
- When you learn new material, immediately create prompts that reinforce key points.
- This helps internalize knowledge as you go.

## Practical Exercise to Get Started

1. **Pick a topic** you want to learn (e.g., AWS EC2).
2. **Read a small section** or watch a short video on it.
3. **Write 5-10 focused prompts** based on what you just learned.
4. **Test yourself** by answering the prompts without looking.
5. **Adjust prompts** that feel confusing or too broad.
6. **Add these prompts to your SRS tool** (Anki, RemNote, etc.).
7. **Review daily** and refine as needed.

## Example: Writing Prompts for AWS EC2

- Q: What does EC2 stand for in AWS?  
  A: Elastic Compute Cloud

- Q: Name two types of EC2 instance purchasing options.  
  A: On-Demand and Spot Instances

- Cloze: EC2 instances are virtual servers in the ________.  
  A: cloud

- Q: What is the primary use case for Spot Instances?  
  A: To run fault-tolerant, flexible workloads at a lower cost.

## Final Tips

- Start small and build your prompt-writing skill gradually.
- Focus on understanding before memorization.
- Use spaced repetition consistently.
- Reflect on your learning and adapt your prompts accordingly.
