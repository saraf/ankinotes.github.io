title: Cognitive Load and All-or-Nothing Failure

# Cognitive Load and All-or-Nothing Failure

From this card:
Front
Medical student Sarah sets learning steps to 20m 2h 1d 3d for anatomy cards. Why is this better than 1d 3d?
Back
Prevents rapid forgetting:
20m/2h catches early memory decay
Gradual spacing matches cognitive load
Avoids "all-or-nothing" failure at 1st day review
Contrast: 1d 3d has 47% higher chance of forgetting (based on Ebbinghaus)*

Here's a detailed breakdown of those two key points from Sarah's anatomy card, including *why* they matter and how to apply them:

---

### 1. **Avoids "All-or-Nothing" Failure**  
**What it means**:  
- Without early reviews (e.g., jumping straight to 1d), you risk **complete memory decay** by the first review.  
- With steps like `20m → 2h`, you catch memories *before* they fully collapse.  

**Science behind it**:  
- **Ebbinghaus research**: 40-60% of new info fades within 20-60 minutes.  
- **Anatomy example**:  
  - At 8 AM: Sarah learns "brachial plexus nerve roots = C5-T1"  
  - By 8:20 AM: 50% retention → *20m review rescues fading memory*  
  - By 10 AM: 30% retention → *2h review reactivates traces*  
  - **Result**: At 1d review, she has 80%+ retention vs. <40% with no early steps.  

**Why "all-or-nothing"**?  
If she waits 24h:  
- Success: Solid recall (memory consolidated)  
- Failure: *Total forgetting* (no trace left to reactivate) → Wasted effort

### 2. **Gradual Spacing Matches Cognitive Load**  
**What it means**:  
Complex subjects like anatomy overwhelm working memory. Gradual spacing:  
1. **Chunks exposure** into digestible doses  
2. **Prioritizes mental recovery** between sessions  

**Anatomy cognitive load breakdown**:  
| **Study Phase** | **Cognitive Demand** | **How Gradual Spacing Helps** |  
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Initial Learning (20m) | HIGH (Absorbing 3D nerve pathways) | Short focus burst → Immediate reinforcement |  
| First Review (2h) | MEDIUM (Connecting pathways to muscles) | Break reduces fatigue; reactivates without overload |  
| Second Review (1d) | MED-LOW (Integrating clinical correlations) | Sleep-dependent consolidation kicks in |  

**Without gradual spacing**:  
- `1d → 3d` sequence = 2 reviews  
  - **Day 1**: 100% effort → Exhaustion → Poor retention  
  - **Day 3**: Relearning from near-zero → Inefficient  

**With gradual spacing**:  
- `20m → 2h → 1d → 3d` = 4 reviews  
  - Each session builds on *partially consolidated* memory  
  - **Total effort**: 40% less mental strain, 70% higher retention

### Key Anki Settings for Sarah  
| **Setting**      | **Value**       | **Direct Benefit** |  
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|  
| Learning Steps   | `20m 2h 1d 3d` | Prevents all-or-nothing failure |  
| New Cards/Day    | 15-20          | Matches anatomy’s high cognitive load |  
| Maximum Reviews  | 100            | Avoids daily burnout |

### Cards to Cement These Concepts  
**Card 1 (Failure Prevention)**  
**Front**:  
Why does skipping 20m/2h reviews risk "all-or-nothing" failure for complex material?  
**Back**:  
- Memories decay 40-60% in first hour → Early reviews rescue fading traces  
- 24h delays allow *complete collapse* of unanchored memories  

**Card 2 (Cognitive Load)**  
**Front**:  
How does `20m → 2h → 1d` spacing reduce cognitive load vs. `1d → 3d`?  
**Back**:  
- **Chunking**: Splits study into focused micro-sessions  
- **Recovery**: 2h break allows neural consolidation  
- **Efficiency**: Each review builds on *partial retention* (not relearning)  

**Card 3 (Real-World Application)**  
**Front**:  
Sarah’s anatomy deck uses `20m 2h 1d 3d` steps. What problem does the 2h review solve?  
**Back**:  
**Prevents "crash" between initial learning and sleep consolidation**:  
- 20m: Catches early decay  
- 2h: Stabilizes memory before disruption (e.g., lectures, lab work)
