# When sharing deck - ensure that basic questions are asked first

## Ensuring Basic Questions Appear First in Your Anki Deck

To make sure your Anki deck presents the most basic questions first—before sharing it with your team—you’ll want to manually organize and reposition your cards. Here’s how you can do this effectively:

### 1. Use the Anki Browser to Sort and Reorder Cards

- **Open the Browser:** In Anki, click on “Browse” to view all cards in your deck.
- **Sort by Field:** If your cards have a field indicating their difficulty or topic order (e.g., “Level,” “Rank,” or a custom field), click on that column header to sort accordingly. If not, you can sort by “Created” to arrange by the order you made the cards[1].
- **Manual Sorting:** If you need a custom order (e.g., basic to advanced), you can manually drag or select cards in the desired sequence.

### 2. Reposition Cards

- **Select All Cards:** After sorting, select all the cards you want to reorder.
- **Reposition:** Right-click and choose “Reposition.” Set the starting number to 1 and apply. This updates the cards’ internal position so Anki knows the new order[2][3].
- **Verify Order:** Double-check the “Due” or “Position” column to confirm the order matches your intended progression.

### 3. Adjust Deck Options for New Card Order

- **Deck Options:** Go to your deck, click the gear icon, and select “Options.”
- **New Card Gather Order:** Set this to “Ascending position” or “Order added” so cards are drawn in the order you’ve set[4].
- **New Card Sort Order:** Ensure this is set to “Order gathered” or “Card type, then order gathered” if you want to control the sequence tightly.

### 4. (Optional) Use Tags or Subdecks

- **Tags:** Assign tags like “basic,” “intermediate,” and “advanced” to your cards. This allows you to filter and review subsets easily[5].
- **Subdecks:** For larger decks, consider splitting cards into subdecks by difficulty. Anki will present cards from subdecks in alphabetical order, so prefix subdeck names with numbers if needed (e.g., “01_Basics,” “02_Intermediate”)[4][6].

### 5. Save and Share

- Once your cards are in the desired order, export your deck. The order will be preserved for new cards as long as your teammates use the same deck settings.

**Tip:** The card order for *new* cards is determined by their position, not just how they appear in the browser. Always use the reposition function after sorting to lock in your preferred sequence[2][3][7].

By following these steps, you can ensure your team will see the most basic questions first, progressing to more advanced material as they continue through the deck.
