# Guiding principles for Deck and Sub-Deck structure

## Guiding Principles for Deck and Sub-Deck Structure in Anki

**1. Decks Are for Scheduling, Not Content Organization**

- The primary purpose of decks and sub-decks in Anki is to control scheduling and review settings, not to organize content topics [^1] [^5].
- Decks allow you to set different review options (like new card limits, intervals, etc.) for different groups of cards[^5].
- If you want different scheduling for different subjects (e.g., more frequent reviews for a language vs. history), use separate decks or sub-decks[^1] [^5].

**2. Use Tags for Content Organization**

- Tags are superior for organizing and labeling content because you can add multiple tags to a single card, allowing for flexible categorization[^1] [^2] [^3].
- Tags can be hierarchical (using `::`), making them as powerful as sub-decks for organizing by topic, chapter, or theme [^3].
- You can filter and study by tags, making it easy to review specific topics across decks[^1][^3].

**3. Prefer Simpler Deck Structures**

- Overly complex deck/sub-deck hierarchies can slow down Anki and make management harder[^6].
- Many experienced users recommend one main deck per subject or course, with sub-decks only if you need different scheduling or want to break up very large subjects (e.g., by exam block or semester)[^3] [^6].
- Too many decks can fragment your reviews, making it harder to keep up and risking missed cards[^1].

**4. Decks Are the Unit of Sharing**

- If you plan to share or export cards, decks are the unit you’ll use for this purpose[^5].

**5. Sub-Decks for Major Divisions Only**

- Use sub-decks for major, logical divisions (e.g., a course with sub-decks for each exam or module), not for every minor topic[^6].
- Remember, all cards in sub-decks can be reviewed together from the parent deck[^6].

**6. Adjust as Your Needs Change**

- Start simple and reorganize only if you find a clear need (e.g., for scheduling, sharing, or managing overwhelming review loads)[^1] [^3] [^5].


## Why These Principles?

- **Efficient Reviews:** Fewer decks mean you’re less likely to miss reviews and can keep up with Anki’s spaced repetition system[^1] [^5].
- **Flexible Organization:** Tags provide multi-dimensional organization, whereas decks are one-dimensional[^1] [^2] [^3].
- **Custom Scheduling:** Decks let you tailor review settings to the needs of different subjects or exam blocks[^1] [^3] [^5].
- **Performance:** Simpler structures keep Anki running smoothly and make it easier to manage your collection[^6].
- **Ease of Sharing:** Decks are easy to export and share, so keeping shareable content in its own deck is practical[^5].


## Summary Table

| Use Case | Best Tool |
| :-- | :-- |
| Different review settings | Decks/Sub-decks |
| Organizing content/topics | Tags |
| Sharing/exporting | Decks |
| Reviewing everything at once | Parent deck |
| Filtering by topic/subject | Tags |

**In short:**

- Use decks and sub-decks primarily for scheduling and sharing.
- Use tags for content organization and filtering.
- Keep your deck structure as simple as possible to avoid management headaches and review fragmentation [^1] [^3] [^5] [^6].
