# Strong Deck - How do I know if a Deck is a strong deck
Created on: 2025-07-04T12:10:07

## Identifying a 'Strong' Deck

A **'strong' deck** in spaced repetition (like Anki) is one where:

- You consistently recall most cards with ease.
- Your review sessions have a high correct answer rate (typically 85–90% or higher).
- Cards feel easy, and you rarely need to relearn or fail items.
- The content is well-formulated, clear, and not confusing or ambiguous.
- You notice that reviews are becoming repetitive or too frequent for material you already know well[1][2].

### Signs Your Deck Is Strong

- **High Retention Rate:** If your review statistics show you are getting 85–90% (or more) of cards correct, your deck is likely strong[1][3].
- **Low Perceived Difficulty:** You rarely struggle to recall answers, and reviews feel easy.
- **Few Lapses:** Cards rarely return to the learning queue.
- **Stable or Decreasing Review Burden:** The number of daily reviews is manageable or feels excessive for your current mastery.

## Why Increase the Interval Modifier Beyond 100%?

The **Interval Modifier** in Anki multiplies the interval between reviews for all cards in a deck. Setting it above 100% (e.g., 120%) means you will see cards less frequently, as intervals grow faster[4][5].

### Reasons to Increase the Interval Modifier

- **Reduce Review Burden:** If a deck is strong, you can safely increase the interval modifier to reduce the number of daily reviews without significantly impacting retention[4][1].
- **Optimize for Time:** Free up time for new learning or other activities by not over-reviewing material you already know well.
- **Avoid 'Ease Hell':** Prevent cards from being reviewed too often, which can lead to boredom and wasted time[4].
- **Maintain Engagement:** Keeping reviews challenging (but not too hard) helps with long-term retention and motivation.

### Use Cases for >100% Interval Modifier

- **Mature Decks:** Decks you have reviewed for months or years, where most cards are mature and rarely missed.
- **Well-Formulated Cards:** Decks with clear, concise, and unambiguous cards.
- **High Retention, Low Lapses:** When your statistics show high retention and few lapses, indicating you are over-reviewing.
- **Reducing Burnout:** If you feel overwhelmed by reviews but are not forgetting material, increasing the interval modifier can help[2][1].

## Practical Steps

1. **Check Your Stats:** Look at your deck’s retention rate and lapse statistics.
2. **Adjust the Interval Modifier:** In deck options, increase the interval modifier (e.g., from 100% to 120%).
3. **Monitor Retention:** After a few weeks, check if your retention rate remains high (ideally 80–90%). If it drops too much, lower the modifier[1][6].
4. **Iterate as Needed:** Fine-tune the modifier to balance review workload and retention.

## Summary Table

| Deck Characteristic         | Action                                  | Why Increase Interval Modifier?         |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| High correct rate (>85%)   | Increase interval modifier (>100%)       | Reduce unnecessary reviews[4][1]       |
| Few lapses                 | Increase interval modifier (>100%)       | Maintain efficiency, avoid burnout[2]  |
| Deck feels too easy        | Increase interval modifier (>100%)       | Keep reviews challenging                |
| Overwhelming review count  | Increase interval modifier (>100%)       | Lower daily review burden[4][1]        |

## Key Takeaway

**Increase the interval modifier above 100% for decks you know well, to reduce review frequency and make your study time more efficient, as long as your retention rate remains high.**[4][1][5]
