title: Do not learn, if you do not understand
---

# Do not learn, if you do not understand

This quote — **"Do not learn if you do not understand"** — is one of the core principles laid out by **Piotr Woźniak**, the inventor of *spaced repetition* software SuperMemo. It may seem obvious, but it's radically deep when taken seriously — and highly relevant to using Anki, creating test questions, or mentoring a team.

Let's unpack it in **precise terms**, as you requested.

---

## 🔍 What Does “Learn” Mean Here?

In Woźniak's context, **"learn"** means:

> To encode information into **long-term memory** using tools like spaced repetition (e.g., SuperMemo or Anki).

### ✅ It is not:

* Casual exposure
* Reading passively
* Skimming or guessing

### ❗ It **is**:

* Making a deliberate, durable mental commitment to a piece of knowledge
* Investing effort to **retain** it for years through systematic review

So when he says "do not learn," he means:

> Don’t enter something into your memory system unless it's worth the **cognitive maintenance cost** — and **you actually get what it means**.

---

## 🧠 What Does “Understand” Mean?

To **understand** means:

> To **mentally model** a concept — to grasp how and why it works, and how it connects to other ideas.

Woźniak's definition aligns with **deep learning** in cognitive science:

| Superficial Understanding | Deep Understanding            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Memorizes the definition  | Can explain it in own words   |
| Can recall a fact         | Can apply it in a new context |
| Recognizes the answer     | Can derive the answer         |
| Uses examples             | Can generate counter-examples |

So, **“understand”** means:

* You can paraphrase it in your own words
* You can teach it to someone else
* You can use it to solve a real problem

## 🧪 How Do You *Test* for Understanding?

### ✅ Try these before you add a fact to Anki:

#### 1. **Feynman Test**

> “Explain it to a 10-year-old.”

If you can’t do that, you don’t understand it yet. Simplify and refine until you can.

---

#### 2. **Backward Recall**

> “Can I generate this knowledge from first principles?”

Instead of memorizing “S3 supports eventual consistency,” ask:
“Why *does* S3 have eventual consistency? When does it matter?”

---

#### 3. **Application Check**

> “Can I apply this to solve a problem?”

If you’re learning about **IAM roles**, ask:

* Can I sketch an architecture where IAM roles make sense?
* Can I troubleshoot a misconfigured permission?

---

#### 4. **Card Creation Test**

> “Can I create a clear, unambiguous Anki card for this?”

If not, your understanding might still be too vague.

---

## 🚫 What Happens If You Learn Without Understanding?

If you violate this rule:

* You will **review meaningless facts** that don’t integrate into your thinking
* Your cards will feel like a **burden**
* You won’t recognize when or why to use the knowledge
* You will experience **cognitive dissonance**: retention without usefulness

---

## ✅ A Simple Practice for Your Bootcamp

Whenever a team member creates a flashcard, have them do a **quick understanding check**:

* Can they teach the idea in <1 min?
* Can they give an example *and* a counter-example?
* Can they write a short test question on it?

If yes → it's ready to go into Anki.
If no → time to dig deeper.
