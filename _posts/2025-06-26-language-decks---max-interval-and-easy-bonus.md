# Language Decks - Max Interval and Easy Bonus

## Why is it a good idea to keep Max Interval at Unlimited and Easy Bonus at the default value for Language decks?

Keeping **Max Interval = Unlimited** and **Easy Bonus = Default (130%)** in language decks aligns with the *psychology of long-term vocabulary acquisition* and prevents two major pitfalls:

---

### 🧠 **Why Unlimited Max Intervals?**
1. **Language Needs Lifelong Exposure**:  
   - Unlike exam material, vocabulary requires **decades of reinforcement**.  
   - Capping intervals (e.g., 180d) forces artificial reviews of mastered words → *wastes time*.  
   - *Example*: The word "perro" (dog) should eventually reach 5-year intervals if truly known.  

2. **Encourages Organic Forgetting/Relearning**:  
   - Small lapses on mature words (*"Hmm... was it gato or gata?"*) strengthen memory through **reconsolidation**.  
   - Unlimited intervals allow this natural process.  

3. **Avoids False Confidence**:  
   - Caps trick you into thinking "I know this forever!" → but language decays without real-world use.  
   - Unlimited intervals reveal *true* retention gaps.

### ⚖️ **Why Default Easy Bonus (130%)?**
1. **Balances Reward vs. Overconfidence**:  
   - Language learners often **overestimate mastery** (e.g., recognizing "biblioteca" ≠ recalling it).  
   - 130% gives a modest boost → intervals grow steadily without escaping to oblivion.  

2. **Prevents "Easy" Abuse**:  
   - Aggressive Easy Bonus (e.g., 200%) would let cards leap to 2-year intervals after 1-2 reviews.  
   - *Result*: Words like "ser" (to be) disappear before conjugation is deeply ingrained.  

3. **Protects Against Interference**:  
   - Similar words (*ser* vs. *estar*, *por* vs. *para*) compete in memory.  
   - Moderate intervals ensure competing pairs are reviewed close together.

### 📊 Real-World Impact
| **Setting**              | **Risk if Changed**          | **Optimal for Language** |  
|--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|  
| **Max Interval = 365d**  | "apple" reviewed yearly → Wasted time | **Unlimited**: Masters escape; strugglers stay |  
| **Easy Bonus = 200%**    | "gracias" → 4y interval → Forgotten | **130%**: Gradual, reliable spacing |

### 🚫 When to BREAK This Rule
1. **Deadline-Driven Learning** (e.g., vacation in 3 months):  
   - *Temp Cap*: Max Interval = 60d  
   - *Temp Easy Bonus*: 150%  
2. **Characters/Logograms** (e.g., Chinese Hanzi):  
   - Cap at 365d (prevents rare-character decay).

### Key Anki Card  
**Front**:  
Why should language decks keep Max Interval *unlimited* and Easy Bonus at *130%*?  
**Back**:  
- **Max Unlimited**: Avoids wasting reviews on mastered words; enables lifelong retention.  
- **Easy 130%**: Prevents overconfident spacing → protects against interference/forgetting.  
*Exception*: Short-term goals (e.g., A1 exam) justify temporary caps.  

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Use **"Hard" sparingly** in language decks! Each "Hard" reduces ease → risks trapping words like *subjuntivo* in review hell.
