# Converting understanding into good SRS prompts

Transforming understanding into effective Spaced Repetition System (SRS) prompts is a key skill for deep, durable learning. Here’s a practical, step-by-step approach:

---

## 1. **Ensure True Understanding First**

Before creating prompts, make sure you can:
- Explain the concept in your own words.
- Give examples or analogies.
- Answer “how” and “why” questions about it.

*If you can’t do these, revisit the material or seek clarification.*

---

## 2. **Break Down the Concept**

- **Decompose** the topic into small, atomic facts or relationships.
- Identify key terms, processes, principles, and connections.

*Example:*  
Understanding Ohm’s Law (V = IR) involves knowing:
- What each variable means (V, I, R)
- The relationship between them
- How to apply the formula

---

## 3. **Write Focused, Clear Prompts**

- Each prompt should test a single idea or fact.
- Avoid ambiguity and compound questions.
- Use your own words to reinforce understanding.

*Examples for Ohm’s Law:*
- Q: What does the “I” stand for in Ohm’s Law?  
  A: Current (measured in amperes)
- Q: State Ohm’s Law as a formula.  
  A: V = I × R
- Q: If resistance increases and voltage stays the same, what happens to current?  
  A: Current decreases.

---

## 4. **Use Different Prompt Types**

- **Basic Q&A:** Direct questions and answers.
- **Cloze Deletions:** Fill-in-the-blank for key terms or relationships.
- **Application/Scenario:** “Given X, what is Y?” or real-world examples.
- **Why/How Prompts:** To reinforce causal or functional understanding.

*Examples:*
- Cloze: Ohm’s Law: V = ___ × R  
  A: I
- Application: If a circuit has 2Ω resistance and 6V voltage, what is the current?  
  A: 3A

---

## 5. **Test for Understanding, Not Just Recall**

- Ask for explanations or reasoning, not just facts.
- Use prompts that require you to apply or connect ideas.

*Example:*
- Q: Why does increasing resistance in a circuit decrease the current (assuming constant voltage)?  
  A: Because current is inversely proportional to resistance (I = V/R).

---

## 6. **Iteratively Refine Prompts**

- After reviewing, notice which prompts are confusing, too easy, or too broad.
- Split, rephrase, or delete as needed.
- Add prompts for gaps in your understanding.

---

## 7. **Connect Prompts to Real Use Cases**

- Where possible, relate prompts to real-life scenarios or problems you might face.
- This makes the knowledge more meaningful and easier to recall.

## **Summary Table**

| Step                | Action                                      | Example                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1. Understand       | Explain in your own words                    | “Ohm’s Law relates V, I, and R.”     |
| 2. Break Down       | Identify atomic facts/relationships          | “I = current, measured in amperes.”  |
| 3. Write Prompts    | Focused, clear, one idea per prompt          | “What does ‘V’ stand for?”           |
| 4. Use Types        | Q&A, cloze, application, why/how             | “If R increases, what happens to I?” |
| 5. Test Reasoning   | Ask for explanations or applications         | “Why does I decrease if R increases?”|
| 6. Refine           | Edit, split, or improve unclear prompts      |                                      |
| 7. Connect          | Use real-world or practical scenarios        | “Calculate I for R=2Ω, V=6V.”        |

## **Example: Transforming Understanding into SRS Prompts**

Suppose you’ve just learned about AWS IAM roles.  
- **Understanding:**  
  “IAM roles allow AWS resources to assume permissions without using long-term credentials.”

- **Prompts:**
  - Q: What is the main purpose of an AWS IAM role?  
    A: To grant permissions to AWS resources without long-term credentials.
  - Q: Which AWS service allows EC2 instances to assume roles?  
    A: IAM
  - Cloze: IAM roles provide ______-term credentials to AWS resources.  
    A: short

## **Final Tips**

- Write prompts as if explaining to your future self.
- Focus on the “aha!” moments—what made the concept click for you.
- Don’t be afraid to update or delete prompts as your understanding evolves.
