# How does Retrievability affect new Stability after review
Created on: 2025-07-13T13:20:34

**Retrievability**—the probability of recalling a memory at the time of review—has a significant influence on the **increase in stability** (the durability of a memory) after a review.

Research and models of memory, including those used in spaced repetition systems, show that:

- **Stability increases more when retrievability is low at the time of review.** In other words, if a memory is harder to recall (retrievability is low), successfully retrieving it during review results in a larger boost to its long-term stability than if the memory was easily recalled (retrievability is high)[3][9].
- This relationship is sometimes described as a "desirable difficulty": challenging retrievals lead to greater strengthening of the memory trace[3].
- The **new stability** after a review is thus a function of both the previous stability and the retrievability at the time of review. When retrievability is high (the memory is fresh), reviewing still increases stability, but the increment is smaller compared to when retrievability is low[3][9][4].
- Spaced repetition algorithms, such as SuperMemo and FSRS (used in Anki), use this principle to optimize review intervals: they aim to schedule reviews when retrievability is neither too high nor too low, maximizing the benefit to stability[4][6][9].

In summary, **lower retrievability at the time of review leads to a greater increase in new stability after review**, making the memory more durable and slowing future forgetting[3][9].
