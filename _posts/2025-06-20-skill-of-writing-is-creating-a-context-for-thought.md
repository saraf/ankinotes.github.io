# Skill of writing is creating a context for thought

For this question, you are Michael Nielsen - or his mentor. Elucidate the following statement in his essay -
 'Edwin Schlossberg: "The skill of writing is creating a context in which people can think". Even more important: it's creating a context in which the writer can think. Done skillfully, it makes it much easier to have certain thoughts. Creating Anki cards is an example of such writing.' Give me good examples of how.

Absolutely — let's now speak with the **voice of Michael Nielsen**, or perhaps that of his imagined mentor — someone deeply grounded in science, writing, cognition, and design of thought tools.

> **“The skill of writing is creating a context in which people can think.” – Edwin Schlossberg**

To this, I add:

> “Even more important: it's creating a context in which *the writer* can think.”

Let’s explore this carefully, especially the link between **writing, context, and cognition** — and how **creating Anki cards** becomes a powerful embodiment of this principle.

### 🧠 Writing as a Thinking Tool

Most people think of writing as **output** — a way to communicate what’s already in your head. But that’s mistaken.

> *Writing is not primarily a way of saying what you think.
> It is a way of figuring out what you think.*

This is what Schlossberg is getting at. And I take it one step further: **If you write skillfully, you shape the thoughts that can occur** — in yourself, or in others.

This is what physicists do when they design good equations. What poets do when they choose words that unlock emotional resonance. And what serious learners do when they write **good Anki cards**.

## 🧩 So, How Is Writing Anki Cards “Creating a Context to Think”?

Because when you write a good card, you’re **concretizing thought**. You’re:

1. **Breaking an idea down into an atomic, testable unit.**
2. **Framing a question that activates memory, not just recognition.**
3. **Selecting a cue that triggers useful mental associations.**
4. **Eliminating ambiguity that clouds understanding.**

You are **engineering your future mind** to recognize what matters.

Let’s look at examples.

## ✅ Example 1: Card that Forces Precision

### ✍️ You’re learning: “S3 is eventually consistent for overwrite PUTs in some regions.”

A weak card:

> Q: What kind of consistency does S3 have?

This is vague. It will provoke fuzzy, shallow recall.

A *thinking-oriented* card:

> Q: What consistency model does S3 use for overwrite PUTs in US Standard region?

You are now teaching yourself to **think precisely about edge cases**.
This card *teaches you what to notice* in future designs.

## ✅ Example 2: Card that Encodes a Conceptual Distinction

Learning about IAM:

A naive card:

> Q: What is an IAM role?

A better card:

> Q: How does an IAM *role* differ from an IAM *user*?

Now the card creates **a context in which comparison becomes habitual**.
You’ve constructed a slot in your mind where differences get stored and tested.
You are not just memorizing, you’re shaping **discriminative thinking**.

---

## ✅ Example 3: Card that Trains Application

Learning about MQTT:

Instead of:

> Q: What is MQTT?

Use:

> Q: Why might MQTT be better than HTTP for an IoT sensor that sends frequent, small updates?

Now you are not reciting a definition — you are activating **model-based reasoning**. You’re using the flashcard as a scaffold for **scenario-based learning**.

That’s what I mean by a **context that makes it easier to have certain thoughts**.

---

## 🧠 Why Is This Powerful?

When you craft such cards:

* You’re encoding what kind of **mental moves** are useful.
* You’re highlighting **what to notice** when encountering new problems.
* You’re building **cognitive hooks** that cause understanding to deepen over time.

This is the *difference between memorization and memory as a cognitive interface*.

## 🎯 The Writer Learns What to Think About

If I can leave you with one core message:

> **The process of creating Anki cards — done well — is not a rote task.
> It is the act of designing thought.**

You are not just making review prompts.

You are creating a **personal language for reasoning**, a context in which it becomes easier — and more natural — to *have good thoughts* about your domain.

That’s what great writing, teaching, and learning have in common.

Would you like me to help you create a checklist or rubric for identifying when an Anki card is "cognitively rich" — i.e., supporting the kind of thinking that Schlossberg and I are talking about?
