# Memorizing speeches using Anki - one possible method
Created on: 2025-07-22T11:15:48



I learn entire speeches for recitals. My process is convoluted as I don't exclusively use Anki, but the relevant parts are:

    Split the text up into bite-size chunks - I tend to break naturally on a breath, comma, full-stop, etc.

    Next I convert that text into the initials

    Add the opening sentence into Anki, then the initials, and the answer is the next sentence.

    Add other cards giving less and less of a clue as to the answer.

I add the line numbers too which I find helps me know where I am when just looking at initials.
Example - Let's say I wanted to learn the opening passage of the Bible:

In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth.
And the Earth was without form, and void;
and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

The initials are:
I T B G C T H A T E
A T E W W F A V
A D W U T F O T D
A T S O G M U T F O T W

Aside: an interesting observation that can help with memorisation: the word HATE is seen in the initials followed by ATE.

So, I'd have the material first of all like:

Q card.
(#1 - In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. )
#2. A T E W W F A V
(#3 - and darkness was upon the face of the deep. )

A card.
#2 - And the Earth was without form, and void;

The brackets let me know those are supporting elements, it's the section without brackets that I need to recite as the answer

Then after that I'd have some questions without the next line as a clue. :

Q card.
(#1 - In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. )
#2. A T E W W F A V

A.
#2 - And the Earth was without form, and void;

Then the next set of cards would be along the lines of the following with less of a clue as to the context.

Q. #2. And The E W W F A V.
A. #2 - And the Earth was without form, and void;

And then on to cards such as the next, which gives the previous line as initials, and we then have to work out the current line, without too many clues:

Q.
(#1. - In The B G C T H A T E )
#2.

A.
#2 - And the Earth was without form, and void;
