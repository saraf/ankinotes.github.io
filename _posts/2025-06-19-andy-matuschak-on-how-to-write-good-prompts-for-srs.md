# Andy Matuschak on How to Write Good Prompts for SRS

## Summary and Explanation

Andy Matuschak’s guide on writing good prompts is focused on maximizing the effectiveness of spaced repetition systems (SRS) for learning and understanding. The guide is both a practical manual and a philosophical reflection on how to use SRS to deeply internalize knowledge, not just memorize facts[1].

**Key Points:**

- **Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS):**  
  SRS tools, like Anki, help users remember information by scheduling reviews at optimal intervals. The quality of your learning depends heavily on the quality of the prompts (questions and answers) you create for these systems[1].

- **The Role of Retrieval Practice:**  
  The core mechanism behind SRS is *retrieval practice*: actively recalling information from memory strengthens your ability to remember it in the future. This process, known as the "testing effect," is much more effective for long-term retention than passive review (like re-reading)[1].

- **Prompt Design is Task Design:**  
  When you write a prompt, you’re designing a recurring task for your future self. If a prompt “works,” it’s because the act of answering it changes you in a useful way—by reinforcing memory, understanding, or skill[1].

- **Properties of Effective Prompts:**  
  Good prompts in SRS should be:
  - **Focused:** Each prompt should target a single detail or concept to avoid overwhelming your memory and to ensure complete, accurate recall.
  - **Precise:** Prompts should clearly specify what is being asked, avoiding vagueness.
  - **Consistent:** The answer should be the same each time, lighting up the same “mental bulbs,” to prevent confusion and interference.
  - **Tractable:** Prompts should be answerable with high accuracy; if they’re too hard, they become frustrating and unproductive.
  - **Effortful:** The prompt should require genuine recall, not just recognition or guessing. The effort involved in retrieval is what strengthens memory[1].

- **Decomposing Knowledge:**  
  To write good prompts, you need to break down complex knowledge into discrete, manageable pieces. This decomposition allows you to create focused prompts and ensures efficient, targeted practice[1].

- **Beyond Memorization—Building Understanding:**  
  While SRS is often used for rote memorization, Matuschak emphasizes using prompts to build deeper understanding and creative fluency. For example, **prompts can help you internalize principles, heuristics, and mental models, not just facts**[1].

- **Practical Example:**  
  The guide uses the example of a chicken stock recipe to show how even practical, everyday knowledge can be broken down into prompts. This approach accelerates the development of practical skills (like cooking) by internalizing foundational knowledge, enabling creativity and confidence[1].

- **The Mnemonic Medium:**  
  Matuschak introduces the idea of a “mnemonic medium,” where educational texts are interleaved with SRS prompts. This allows readers to internalize the material as they read, not just after the fact. The guide itself is an example of this approach, using embedded prompts to reinforce its own advice[1].

**Conclusion:**  
Writing good prompts for spaced repetition is a skill that transforms how you learn. Effective prompts are focused, precise, consistent, tractable, and effortful. By carefully designing prompts, you can use SRS not just to memorize facts, but to build lasting understanding and practical expertise in any domain[1].

> “Spaced repetition systems work only as well as the prompts you give them. And especially when new to these systems, you're likely to give them mostly bad prompts. It often won’t even be clear which prompts are bad and why, much less how to improve them.”[1]

This guide is a systematic attempt to help you overcome those challenges and make your learning with SRS both effective and meaningful.
