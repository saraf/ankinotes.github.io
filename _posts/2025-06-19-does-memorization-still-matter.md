title: Does Memorization still matter?

# Does Memorization still matter?

Absolutely — **memorization is not only relevant but critical in several technical fields**, especially where **precision, speed, and pattern recognition** are essential. Anki, with its spaced repetition system, is a powerful tool for long-term retention in these areas.

## 🔧 **Technical Fields Where Memorization is Still Crucial**

### 1. **Software Development & DevOps**

* 🔑 **Why memorization matters**:

  * Syntax, APIs, flags, commands, error codes, common idioms.
  * Speed while coding or debugging.
* 🎯 Use Anki for:

  * Linux commands, Git CLI, regex patterns, AWS CLI/API/SDK usage.
  * Language-specific patterns: Python decorators, Java annotations, C++ STL, etc.

> Example Card:
> Q: `What does the AWS CLI command "aws s3 sync" do?`
> A: `Synchronizes files between a source and destination.`

### 2. **Cloud Architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP)**

* 🔑 **Why memorization matters**:

  * Service limits, configuration defaults, pricing models, integrations.
  * Cert exams and designing under pressure.
* 🎯 Use Anki for:

  * IAM policy structure, Lambda limits, EC2 instance types, CloudFormation syntax.

---

### 3. **Cybersecurity**

* 🔑 **Why memorization matters**:

  * Ports, protocols, tools, hash types, OWASP vulnerabilities.
* 🎯 Use Anki for:

  * Metasploit commands, common CVEs, encryption standards, firewall rules.

---

### 4. **Embedded Systems / Electronics**

* 🔑 **Why memorization matters**:

  * Pin configurations, register maps, protocol sequences, signal timing.
* 🎯 Use Anki for:

  * SPI vs I2C vs UART, 8051 registers, ADC/DAC conversion formulas.

---

### 5. **Networking**

* 🔑 **Why memorization matters**:

  * Protocol ports, packet structures, IP subnetting, TCP flags.
* 🎯 Use Anki for:

  * CIDR blocks, DNS record types, HTTP response codes.

---

### 6. **Mathematics and Algorithms**

* 🔑 **Why memorization matters**:

  * Formulae, time/space complexities, graph properties.
* 🎯 Use Anki for:

  * Sorting algorithm time complexities, Big-O notation, recurrence relations.

---

### 7. **Data Science / Machine Learning**

* 🔑 **Why memorization matters**:

  * Model parameters, evaluation metrics, statistical assumptions.
* 🎯 Use Anki for:

  * Confusion matrix terms, sklearn method signatures, activation functions.

## 🧠 Why Memorization Still Matters in Tech

> “Understanding is fragile if it relies on memory being outsourced to Google.”
> — Inspired by Richard Feynman

* ⚡️ **Speed matters** — especially in interviews, debugging, and production incidents.
* 🧩 **Mental model depth** — comes from deeply internalized facts.
* 🔁 **Repetition builds intuition** — recognizing patterns faster means solving faster.

## 🪄 Bonus Tip: Use “Minimal Information Principle” in Card Design

* Don’t memorize entire blocks of code.
* Break down into short, focused cloze deletions or one-concept-per-card.

Would you like a mini-deck example for any one of these domains? I can also create a general-purpose Anki template for technical knowledge.
