# Ease Hell - what it is, how to avoid it
Created on: 2025-07-04T12:12:33

**Ease Hell** is a term used in the Anki spaced repetition community to describe a situation where many of your cards have had their **ease factor** (a number that controls how quickly review intervals grow) reduced to the minimum, typically 130%. This occurs when cards are repeatedly marked as "Again" (incorrect) or "Hard," which causes the ease to drop. As a result, these cards are scheduled for review much more frequently than necessary, even if you eventually learn them, leading to an overwhelming review burden and inefficiency[2][5][6].

### Why is Ease Hell a Problem?
- **Excessive Reviews:** Cards with low ease factors come up for review very often, making your daily workload unmanageable and time-consuming[2][5][6].
- **Inefficiency:** You spend too much time reviewing material you may already know, defeating the purpose of spaced repetition, which is to optimize retention with minimal effort[2][5][6].
- **Burnout Risk:** The constant flood of reviews can lead to frustration and burnout, making it harder to keep up with your studies[2][5].

### How Does It Happen?
- **Repeated Lapses:** Every time you fail a card ("Again"), its ease factor drops by 20 points (e.g., from 250% to 230%, then 210%, etc.), until it hits the minimum (usually 130%)[5][6].
- **Frequent Use of "Hard":** Consistently marking cards as "Hard" also lowers the ease, though less dramatically.
- **Poorly Formulated Cards:** Cards that are ambiguous, too complex, or not well-structured are more likely to be failed, accelerating the descent into ease hell.

### How to Avoid Ease Hell
- **Aim for Well-Formulated Cards:** Clear, concise, and unambiguous cards are less likely to be failed repeatedly[5].
- **Use the "Easy" Button Judiciously:** Marking cards as "Easy" increases their ease factor, counteracting the downward spiral[6].
- **Adjust Learning Steps:** Adding more learning steps or adjusting the interval modifier can help prevent cards from reaching low ease prematurely[5][7].
- **Be Honest in Reviews:** Only mark cards as "Good" or "Easy" if you truly remember them, to avoid artificially inflating or deflating ease[5].

> "If this happens to too many of our cards, we enter something called 'ease hell.' We want to avoid it because we will be seeing too many cards too frequently, making Anki unmanageable and inefficient."[5]

In summary, **ease hell** is when a large portion of your cards have low ease factors, causing excessive and inefficient review schedules. It is best prevented by careful card creation, honest self-assessment during reviews, and periodic adjustment of your Anki settings.
