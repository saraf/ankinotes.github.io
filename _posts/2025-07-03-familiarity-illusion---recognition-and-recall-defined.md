# Familiarity Illusion - recognition and recall defined
Created on: 2025-07-03T13:17:48

The **Familiarity Illusion** refers to a cognitive phenomenon in which people mistakenly believe they remember or recognize something simply because it feels familiar, even when they have not actually encountered it before. This illusion is often driven by *perceptual fluency*â€”when a stimulus is processed easily, it can create a false sense of familiarity, leading individuals to make incorrect "old" recognition judgments. For example, if a word or face is presented in a way that makes it easy to perceive (such as high contrast or clear presentation), people are more likely to judge it as something they have seen before, even if they have not[1]. This effect is particularly strong when actual memory retrieval is difficult, causing people to rely more on feelings of familiarity as a heuristic for recognition[1].

**Recognition** is a form of memory characterized by the ability to identify something as familiar when it is encountered again. In psychology, recognition involves correctly identifying a previously experienced stimulus when it is presented, even if the person cannot retrieve specific details about the original encounter[2][3][4]. For example, seeing a face and knowing you have seen it before, even if you cannot recall the person's name, is recognition.

**Recall** is the mental process of retrieving information from memory without the aid of external cues. It requires actively searching for and bringing to mind information that was previously learned or experienced[5][3][4]. For example, trying to remember the name of a person you met at a party without any prompts is an act of recall.
