# Cultivating taste about what to memorize

Excellent question—and exactly the sort of inquiry that shows you're thinking like a builder of thought infrastructure.

When **Michael Nielsen** (or, let's say, *his mentor*) says:

> *“But it's worth cultivating taste in what to memorize,”*

he's making a subtle but powerful point. Memorization isn’t just about stuffing your brain with facts—it’s about developing **an intuition for which facts, frameworks, and distinctions will give you the greatest leverage in thought**.

Let’s unpack this and then explore *how* you can go about cultivating that taste.

## 🧠 What Does “Taste in What to Memorize” Mean?

It’s the difference between:

* Memorizing hundreds of AWS service names...
  **vs.**
  Memorizing how *decoupling* works and when to reach for *event-driven patterns* like SQS/SNS or EventBridge.

It’s the difference between:

* Memorizing HTTP status codes...
  **vs.**
  Memorizing *the logic* of RESTful API design so you can derive the right code when needed.

Taste means developing *a sense for high-yield cognitive investments*.

## 🍷 What Makes Something Worth Memorizing?

Here are guiding questions to develop your “taste”:

### 1. **Will I use this knowledge to solve real problems?**

* If yes, it's worth memorizing.
* Example: How IAM roles work across accounts in AWS. You’ll *need* this when building secure IoT services.

### 2. **Is this knowledge foundational?**

* If it's a building block for many other things, it’s worth it.
* Example: TCP/IP fundamentals, or how pub/sub architectures work.

### 3. **Is this a key distinction or decision point?**

* Memorize things that *guide decisions*—e.g., when to use S3 Glacier vs. Infrequent Access.

### 4. **Does it change how I see the world?**

* A good Anki card helps you build *mental lenses*.
* Example: Understanding the CAP theorem isn't just trivia—it frames every distributed system you design.

### 5. **Will this let me think faster or more clearly under pressure?**

* If a fact lets you perform faster (e.g., diagnosing a cloud outage or picking the right DB), it's gold.

## 🧭 How to Cultivate This Taste — Concrete Practices

### 🔁 1. **Ask “Would this be useful in a live situation?”**

When reviewing or creating Anki cards, ask:

> "Would knowing this help me make a better decision, design, or debug something?"

### 🧩 2. **Pay attention to confusion points**

If something confused you before you understood it—memorize that distinction. It will help future-you and others.

### 🏗️ 3. **Build cards only after understanding**

Piotr Wozniak (creator of spaced repetition) says: *“Do not learn what you do not understand.”*
Only make a card *after* you’ve made sense of it.

### 📘 4. **Annotate your sources with card-worthy insights**

As you watch a video, read a book, or debug a problem, train yourself to spot:

* “That’s a key idea.”
* “That changes how I think.”
* “That would save me time in the future.”

### ✨ 5. **Review your Anki cards periodically—not just for recall but for *value***

Archive/delete cards that feel rote or low value. Add cards that sharpen your edge.

## 💡 Cultivated Taste Looks Like This:

* You memorize **frameworks** over **facts**.
* You prefer **distinctions** over **definitions**.
* You invest in **thought tools**, not trivia.

You're not trying to pass a test. You're trying to become a faster, deeper, more creative problem-solver.
