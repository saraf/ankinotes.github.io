# How to teach and create effective testing questions

I want to learn about pedagogy, how to teach and how to create effective testing questions - that will serve two purposes, it will help cement the knowledge in my brain and it will also help me create anki cards that are very useful for review. It will also help me create tests for my team members, so that knowledge gaps can be identified and filled up. Give me strategies, guidelines and maybe even books that I can read or other resources I can use on the Internet for this.

This is a deeply valuable direction you're taking — learning how to teach effectively is one of the most powerful ways to deepen your own expertise and uplift your team. Here's a structured guide to help you become excellent at **pedagogy, assessment design, and memory reinforcement** through testing and spaced repetition:

---

## 🧠 1. **Key Principles of Effective Teaching & Learning**

### ✅ Foundational Strategies

| Principle                | How It Helps                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Active recall**        | Retrieving info strengthens memory better than re-reading.              |
| **Spaced repetition**    | Reinforces material at optimal intervals (e.g., Anki).                  |
| **Elaboration**          | Explaining concepts in your own words forms deeper understanding.       |
| **Interleaving**         | Mixing topics forces flexible thinking and reduces superficial fluency. |
| **Desirable difficulty** | Make learning *slightly hard* — effortful recall improves retention.    |
| **Dual coding**          | Combine text + visuals (diagrams, mind maps) for better learning.       |

> 🧭 Book recommendation:
> 📘 *“Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning”* by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel — a must-read for understanding how people learn effectively.

## 🛠 2. **How to Create Powerful Anki Cards & Tests**

### 🔍 Focus on *application*, not just definitions.

* **Bad**: What is S3?
* **Good**: Your client stores large video files in S3. They want to reduce cost after 90 days. What should you do?

### 🎯 Use these question types:

| Type                | Purpose                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Conceptual          | Tests understanding of core principles                                       |
| Diagnostic          | Reveals misconceptions or knowledge gaps                                     |
| Scenario-based      | Promotes deep thinking by applying knowledge to real-world situations        |
| Multiple True-False | Better than MCQs for nuanced testing of understanding                        |
| Cloze Deletion      | Great for Anki: e.g., "S3 supports {{c1::eventual consistency}} by default." |

> 📘 Book: *“Designing Effective Instruction”* by Morrison, Ross, Kemp — great for structured instructional design.

## 📚 3. Recommended Resources for Self-Study

### 🎥 Video Courses / MOOCs:

* **Coursera: Learning How to Learn** by Dr. Barbara Oakley (highly accessible)
* **MIT OpenCourseWare - Education**: [https://ocw.mit.edu](https://ocw.mit.edu)
* **edX - Foundations of Teaching for Learning** by Commonwealth Education Trust

### 📘 Books (Highly Practical):

1. **Understanding by Design** – Wiggins & McTighe (backward design for deep learning outcomes)
2. **How Learning Works** – Ambrose et al. (evidence-based principles for instruction)
3. **Teach Like a Champion** – Doug Lemov (especially for assessment and feedback)

---

## 🧪 4. Test & Question Design Tips (especially for tech topics)

### 1. **Use “hinge” questions**

→ Simple multiple choice that reveals a concept-level understanding.

> *E.g.* Which AWS service supports schema versioning for event data?
> A. S3 B. Lambda C. EventBridge D. API Gateway

### 2. **Use mini-scenarios**

→ Put the student in the role of a developer or architect.

> *E.g.* You need to ensure an IoT device can retry sending telemetry. Which service feature helps with this?

### 3. **Try error diagnosis questions**

→ Present a faulty design or piece of code, ask: *What’s wrong here?*

> This mirrors real-world debugging and builds intuition.

## 🪄 5. Strategy for Retention + Application

1. **After each video module**, pause and write:

   * 2–3 Anki cards (recall-based)
   * 1 real-world question you could ask a teammate
2. **Once a week**, quiz your team with 3–5 questions.

   * Ask each team member to *explain their answer*.
   * Log misunderstandings → turn into flashcards or mini-lessons.

---

## 🧰 Tools

* **Anki**: For spaced recall
* **Obsidian**: For structured note-taking and linking knowledge
* **Socratic questioning**: Use “Why?”, “What if?”, “What’s the consequence of...?” often.
* **Bloom’s Taxonomy**: Use this framework to build questions from *remember* to *create*.

---

## ✨ Summary: Your 5-Step Mastery Path

1. **Learn**: Study pedagogy using books/videos above
2. **Reflect**: Ask “How would I teach this?” after learning any concept
3. **Practice**: Make 2-3 Anki cards per concept, apply to a work scenario
4. **Test**: Create small assessments for your team
5. **Teach**: Present + discuss these questions with your team every week

Would you like me to:

* Build a **starter deck of “meta” Anki cards** about pedagogy itself?
* Design a **weekly quiz format** for your team?
* Create a **template in Obsidian or Notion** to help you structure your learning + teaching cycle?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
