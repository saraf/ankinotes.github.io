# Cultivating taste - short version

> “But it's worth cultivating taste in what to memorize.” — Michael Nielsen

## 🧠 What Does This Mean?

Developing taste means knowing **which facts, frameworks, and distinctions** are worth memorizing because they:
- Help you solve real problems.
- Form foundational mental models.
- Enable fast, clear thinking.

- If yes, it's high-yield.
- _Example:_ IAM roles across AWS accounts.

### ✅ 2. Is this knowledge foundational?
- Building blocks for deeper learning.
- _Example:_ TCP/IP, pub/sub patterns.

### ✅ 3. Is this a key distinction or decision point?
- Guides practical judgment.
- _Example:_ S3 Infrequent Access vs. Glacier.

### ✅ 4. Does it change how I see the world?

## 🧭 How to Cultivate This Taste

### 🔁 1. Ask “Would I use this in real life?”
- While creating or reviewing a card.

### 🧩 2. Notice confusion points
- Anything that took effort to understand is often worth retaining.

### 🏗️ 3. Only memorize what you understand
- Don’t memorize before comprehension.

### 📘 4. Annotate your sources
- Spot insights while reading/watching: “Ah, that’s card-worthy.”

### ✨ 5. Prune your Anki deck for value
- Archive low-value cards. Add sharp, practical ones.

## 🧠 What This Looks Like in Practice

- Prefer **frameworks** over **facts**.
- Prefer **distinctions** over **definitions**.
- Prefer **thinking tools** over **trivia**.

You're not just remembering.  
You're **training to think faster, deeper, clearer**.
