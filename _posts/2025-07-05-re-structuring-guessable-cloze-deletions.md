# Re-structuring guessable Cloze Deletions
Created on: 2025-07-05T12:59:08

Here's a crystal-clear explanation with practical examples of restructuring clozes and adding context to prevent guessing:

### 🎯 Problem: Guessable Cloze
```anki
The {{c1::CEO}} of Tesla is Elon Musk.
```
**Why guessable?**  
- "Tesla" strongly cues "CEO"
- "Elon Musk" confirms company leadership role

---

### 🔧 Solution 1: Add Real-World Context  
**Add specific scenarios, consequences, or applications:**  
```anki
During the 2023 investor meeting, Tesla's {{c1::CEO}} announced a 50% price cut for Model Y, causing {{c2::industry-wide}} panic.
```
**Why it works:**  
- Specific event ("2023 investor meeting") requires factual recall
- Added consequence ("industry-wide panic") creates unique mental hook
- Two clozes prevent pattern recognition

**More examples:**  
| Before (Guessable)             | After (Context-Added)                     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `HTTP uses {{c1::port 80}}`    | `Web apps use {{c1::port 80}} for {{c2::unencrypted traffic}} despite {{c3::security risks}}` |
| `{{c1::Mitochondria}} produce energy` | `In cardiac cells, {{c1::mitochondria}} work 24/7 to {{c2::convert}} fatty acids into ATP through {{c3::oxidative phosphorylation}}` |

### 🧩 Solution 2: Restructure the Card  
**Strategy A: Isolate the Core Concept**  
```anki
What position does Elon Musk hold at Tesla?
{{c1::CEO}}
```
**Why better:**  
- Removes all contextual cues
- Forces active recall of relationship

**Strategy B: Reverse the Relationship**  
```anki
Elon Musk serves as {{c1::CEO}} at which company?
{{c2::Tesla}}
```
**Strategy C: Create Multiple Atomic Cards**  
*Card 1:*  
```anki
Tesla's chief executive officer title: {{c1::CEO}}
```
*Card 2:*  
```anki
Current Tesla {{c1::CEO}}: Elon Musk
```
*Card 3:*  
```anki
Elon Musk became Tesla CEO in {{c1::2008}} during the {{c2::financial crisis}}
```

### 🧠 Cognitive Principles Applied  
1. **Contextual Binding Principle**  
   ```anki
   When AWS {{c1::EC2}} instances lose {{c2::network connectivity}}, 
   they fail {{c3::health checks}} and get {{c4::terminated}} by {{c5::auto-scaling groups}}
   ```
   - Each cloze requires understanding system interactions

2. **Eliminate Sentence Scaffolding**  
   **Before:** `Python uses {{c1::lists}} for ordered sequences`  
   **After:** `Mutable ordered sequence type in Python: {{c1::list}}`

3. **Add Problem-Solution Framing**  
   ```anki
   To prevent {{c1::data corruption}} during power failures, 
   databases use {{c2::write-ahead logging}} (WAL)
   ```

---

### 💡 Pro Restructuring Techniques  
1. **Convert to Q&A Format**  
   ```anki
   Q: What Tesla model saw 50% price cuts in 2023?
   A: {{c1::Model Y}}
   ```
   
2. **Use Distinctive Examples**  
   ```anki
   Unlike {{c1::LinkedIn}} (professional) or {{c2::TikTok}} (entertainment), 
   {{c3::Reddit}} is primarily a {{c4::discussion forum}}
   ```
   
3. **Add Visual Anchors**  
   ```anki
   [Diagram of cell] → Energy-producing organelle: {{c1::mitochondria}}
   ```

### ✅ Checklist for Better Clozes  
1. Could I guess this from grammar alone? → **Add technical verbs**  
2. Does only one word logically fit? → **Include edge cases/exceptions**  
3. Is this testable in real life? → **Anchor to concrete scenarios**  

**Final Example Transformation**  
Before:  
```anki
{{c1::Photosynthesis}} requires sunlight
```
After:  
```anki
When {{c1::light-dependent reactions}} occur during {{c2::photosynthesis}}, 
they {{c3::excite electrons}} to split {{c4::water}} molecules in {{c5::Photosystem II}}
```
